Explain the working of below pig script commands with an example:
1. LOAD - Load data from the file system.

eg: demo1 = load '/user/acadgild/Deskstop/input' using PigStorage(',') as (id:int, name:chararray, sal:int);

2. STORE - Store data into the file system.

eg: store demo1 into '/user/acadgild/demo1';

3. DUMP - Displays the result to the screen.

eg: dump demo1;

4. FOREACH - Iterate the tuples of a relation, generating a data transformation.

eg: demo 2 = foreach demo1 generate id;

5. FILTER - Select a set of tuples from a relation based on condition.

eg: demo3 = filter demo1 by sal>2000;

6. GROUP BY - Group data in one or more relations.

eg: demo4 = group demo1 by id;

7. ORDER BY - Sort a relation based on one or more fields.

eg: demo5 = order demo2 by ASC;

8. DESCRIBE - Returns the schema of an alias.

eg: describe demo1;
